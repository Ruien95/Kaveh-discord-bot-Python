The discord bot is run on replit so that I use the wbesite UptimeRobot (https://uptimerobot.com/) to keep my bot alive 24/7.

As replit uses shared IP addresses, your bot will be sharing the same IP address with other people's bots. Hence, it is likely that the bot will get ratelimited/temporarily banned as from discord's side, it looks like they are getting spammed requests from a single IP address.

You can wait the ban out or type kill 1 into the shell and run the bot again. Might have to repeat a few times to get the bot running again.
